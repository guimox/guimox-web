    <TextTitle bold>A thing or two about me</TextTitle>
    <TextParagraph>
      I'm a software developer who loves <b>experimenting and learning new things</b>. Whether it's building
      frontend apps with frameworks like React or Angular, managing backend systems with Springboot, or diving into
      side projects with Golang (a personal favorite). I'm always looking for opportunities to create and improve.
    </TextParagraph>
    <TextParagraph>
      I enjoy trying a bit of everythingâ€”designing user-friendly interfaces, optimizing backend logic, or even
      exploring how to make infrastructure work better. <b>One thing I really focus on is simplicity.</b>
    </TextParagraph>
    <TextParagraph>
      I like to lower the barriers to getting started and keeping things running smoothly, which is why I almost
      always use Docker to containerize my projects and ensure they're easy to deploy and maintain. I've also
      gained experience working with infrastructure, experimenting with CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, and
      setting up VPS environments to streamline workflows and deployments.
    </TextParagraph>
    <TextParagraph>
      For me, it's all about turning ideas into something practical and sustainable while keeping the process fun.
      <b>I'm always up for learning</b>, building, and seeing how a small experiment can grow into something great.
