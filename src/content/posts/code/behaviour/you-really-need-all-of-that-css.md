### Decision making

In web development, making decisions is part of the job. We deal with databases, system design, CI/CD, coding patterns, and frontend work—all of which can feel overwhelming before we even start coding. While these decisions are necessary for the success of a project, they can sometimes hold us back, especially when we’re obsessing over details, like pixel-perfect designs.

### The perfectionism trap

As developers, we are like the Leonardo da Vincis of our time. We create amazing things, and ensuring they’re of good quality is a top priority. However, striving for perfection can be counterproductive. It can slow us down when we need to deliver features or complete projects. Of course, following best practices is important, but even these can become obstacles if we let them get in the way of finishing and sharing our work.

### When CSS gets in the way

CSS isn’t the bad guy—it’s a powerful tool for creating beautiful, functional pages. As someone who works on the frontend, I’ve seen how CSS can transform a website. Just look at the amazing designs featured on Awwwards for proof. But sometimes, CSS can also make it hard to move forward.

Take my own website, for example. I’ve refactored it countless times, but I was never fully satisfied. With only a few projects to showcase, I kept stressing over how stylish and polished my portfolio needed to be. After looking at other web developers' portfolios and reflecting on my website's purpose, I realized that the design doesn’t need to be the standout feature. Tailwind CSS and JavaScript are helpful tools, but I don’t have all the time in the world to make my site the most beautiful one out there. And that’s okay.

### You’re not a perfectionist, you’re a developer

CSS is just one piece of the puzzle. As developers, we juggle best practices for authentication, databases, CI/CD, and more. The important thing is to focus on the bigger picture. The code you wrote yesterday might not be your best, and that’s fine.

Your users won’t interact with your terminal or see your code. They just need a good experience—not a Mona Lisa.
