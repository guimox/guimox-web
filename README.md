### Markdown

The posts are fetched from a separate repository called guimox-posts. The posts are fetched using Github Actions everyday at 00:00. I know, it's a little bit of overenginnering.

### Aim to be simple

The overall website is aimed to be simple and fast. I tried to make a stylish website but I failed.
