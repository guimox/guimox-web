# My website (Guimox Website)

### Tech stack

- Github Actions

### Markdown

The posts are fetched from a separate repository called guimox-posts. The posts are fetched using Github Actions everyday at 00:00. I know, it's a little bit of overenginnering.

### Aim to be simple, but it can be simplier

As the posts are fetched from another repository, I also create a simpler version of the same website for users that like simplicity.
